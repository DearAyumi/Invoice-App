# Invoice-App
A small web application with different authorization user settings to manage invoices.


Normal users can only add and edit their own invoices, and see the status of each invoice.
Manager role users can see all invoices, without the authorization to edit or delete them. They can accept/reject the invoices and update the status.
Admin roles can do all of the above, and be able to see the yearly revenue of all uploaded invoices in the database.
